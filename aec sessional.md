*Each question carries 1 mark (1x10=10)*

**a. What do body language, facial expression, and gestures signify?**  
Body language, facial expressions, and gestures are forms of non-verbal communication. They signify emotions, attitudes, and reactions without the use of words. For example, a smile can indicate happiness, while clenched fists might show anger or tension.

Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, or feelings between individuals or groups using methods like speaking, writing, or gestures.

**d. Name one factor required for a complete and successful communication process.**  
Feedback is a key factor. It confirms that the message has been received and understood, completing the communication loop.

### **Section 2: Answer any five of the following (15 marks)**  
*Each question carries 3 marks (3x5=15)*  
*I will answer questions i, ii, iii, iv, and v.*

**i. What is the difference between verbal and non-verbal communication?**  
Verbal communication involves using words to convey a message, either through speaking (e.g., a conversation) or writing (e.g., a letter). Non-verbal communication, however, uses no words and relies on body language (e.g., posture), facial expressions (e.g., a frown), gestures (e.g., waving), and tone of voice to express meaning. Verbal communication is direct and clear, while non-verbal communication can be subtle and sometimes harder to interpret accurately.

**ii. How has technology impacted communication processes today in terms of speed, connectivity, and access?**  
Technology has transformed communication in several ways. In terms of **speed**, tools like emails and instant messaging allow messages to be sent and received instantly, unlike older methods like letters. For **connectivity**, the internet and smartphones connect people across the globe, making it easy to communicate with someone far away. Regarding **access**, technology provides more people with communication tools, such as social media platforms, which are widely available and affordable, allowing broader participation in sharing and receiving information.

**iii. Explain why paying attention is important in effective communication.**  
Paying attention is critical in communication because it ensures the listener understands the speaker’s message fully. By focusing on both the words and non-verbal cues (like tone or gestures), the listener can grasp the intended meaning and respond appropriately. For example, if someone is speaking sarcastically but the listener isn’t paying attention, they might miss the sarcasm and misunderstand the message. Attention reduces confusion and makes communication more effective.

**iv. Define communication and its elements.**  
Communication is the process of sharing information, ideas, or emotions between a sender and a receiver through a common medium, such as speech or writing. Its key elements are:  
- **Sender**: The person who starts the communication by creating a message.  
- **Message**: The information or idea being shared.  
- **Encoding**: Turning the message into a form (e.g., words or gestures) for transmission.  
- **Channel**: The medium used to send the message (e.g., phone, email).  
- **Receiver**: The person who gets the message.  
- **Decoding**: The receiver interpreting the message.  
- **Feedback**: The receiver’s response, showing if the message was understood.  
- **Noise**: Any interference (e.g., loud sounds or distractions) that affects the process.

**v. Write a short note on the qualities required to become a good speaker.**  
A good speaker needs several qualities to communicate effectively:  
- **Clarity**: Speaking in a way that’s easy to understand.  
- **Confidence**: Showing assurance to gain the audience’s trust.  
- **Engagement**: Keeping the audience interested with energy or examples.  
- **Empathy**: Understanding the audience’s needs and adjusting the message accordingly.  
- **Organization**: Structuring the speech logically with a clear start, middle, and end.  
- **Voice modulation**: Varying tone and pace to emphasize points and maintain interest.  
These qualities help a speaker deliver their message powerfully and connect with listeners.
